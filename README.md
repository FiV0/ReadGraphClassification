Project for experimenting with read graphs.

Contains a linear LexBFS implementation as described in
![Lex-BFS and partition refinement, with applications to transitive orientation, interval graph recognition and consecutive ones testing, Habib et al](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397597002417). See [algo.cpp][./SRC/algo.cpp] for details.

Contains a fast (in practice) diameter algoritm as described in
![On computing the diameter of real-world undirected graphs](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397512008687).
See [algo_clique.cpp][./SRC/algo_clique.cpp]
